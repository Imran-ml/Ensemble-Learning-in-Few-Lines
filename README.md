## Introduction

In machine learning, ensemble methods use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone.

## Environment Setup

**Prerequisites**: Ensure Python 3.6 or newer is installed on your system.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Install `virtualenv` if you prefer it over the built-in `venv` (optional):
        ```bash
        pip install virtualenv
        ```
    - Create the environment:
        - With `venv` (Python 3.3+):
            ```bash
            python -m venv env
            ```
        - Or, with `virtualenv`:
            ```bash
            virtualenv env
            ```
    - Activate the environment:
        - Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
        - Unix/MacOS: `source env/bin/activate`
    - To deactivate: `deactivate`

2. **Dependencies**:
    Ensure all dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Conclusion


The goal of any machine learning problem is to find a single model that will best predict our wanted outcome. Rather than making one model and hoping this model is the best/most accurate predictor we can make, ensemble methods take a myriad of models into account, and average those models to produce one final model.
